# G20 Development Through the ESG Lens  
**Measuring Progress Beyond GDP**

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes G20 countries through an **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)**  
framework to move beyond traditional development metrics like GDP.  
Using **World Bank data (2011–2021)**, it combines data analytics, visualization,  
and economic interpretation to evaluate sustainable development patterns.

##  Objectives
- Evaluate G20 development using ESG indicators  
- Identify cross-country disparities and policy gaps  
- Apply data analytics tools to real-world economic questions  
- Translate insights into policy-relevant conclusions
